## WHAT ARE THESE FILES

The files in this directory fit into one of two categories:
* the original APK files for the FTC SDK
* utility files used by FTAs to help in debugging, phone inspection, and event management

Each script describes what it does in a block at the top. Most scripts show this block when the script is executed.

## Downloading the Project

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p><tt>git clone https://github.com/JohnMMcD/Team5873SkyStone.git</tt></p>

[You might want to download Perl](https://perl.org/get.html) to clean up the log files after they are downloaded.
