## WHAT ARE THESE FILES

The files in this directory fit into one of two categories:
* the original APK files for the FTC SDK
* utility files used by FTAs to help in debugging, log file analysis, phone inspection, and event management

Each script describes what it does in a block at the top. Most scripts show this block when the script is executed.

## Downloading the Project

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p><tt>git clone https://github.com/JohnMMcD/Team5873SkyStone.git</tt></p>

* You can download [download_files.cmd](download_files.cmd) and [download_files.ps1](download_files.ps1) to pull down the files in this directory and also several files needed to run an event. For example, the game manuals, the latest answers to the forum questions, and the .apk files which are legal in the current season.

[You might want to download Perl](https://perl.org/get.html) to clean up the log files after they are downloaded.
